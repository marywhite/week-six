git init
git add . (this is how i've always added all new files to stagin. I know codeschool mentioned git add --all. I'm curious to  know why you'd use one over the other)
git commit -m "add README and empty text file"
git remote add origin git@github.com:marywhite/week-six.git
git push -u origin master
subl hello.txt (presently editing hello.txt in sublime)
